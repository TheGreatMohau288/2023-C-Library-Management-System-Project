# 2023-C Plus Plus-Library-Management-System-Project
This is a project we were given by our Computer Science lecturer in 2023, using the C++ programming language. We were given a topic, "Insertion Sort" and were expected to create anything that would illustrate how insertion sorting functions. My group members and I decided to create a Library Management System.
